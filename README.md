## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce:

* How to create semantic and accessible HTML structures
* How to use `rem` and `em` units for responsive typography
* How to structure content using Grid and Flexbox
* Mobile-first styling and tweaking for desktop responsiveness

Example:

```css
.preparation-time {
  background-color: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
  border-radius: 0.75rem;
  padding: 1.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to keep practicing:

* Pixel-perfect reproduction from design files
* Better color/contrast accessibility
* Fluid typography for better responsiveness

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Always my go-to for checking CSS and HTML references.
* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helpful for layout and spacing tips.
